Introduction
The use of technology has become a common practice in educational settings, including higher education. Teachers and students have access to a wide variety of technologies that can improve learning and teaching. However, the use of technology in higher education is not uniform and widespread. The question, therefore, is why some people are more inclined to use technology than others.
Problem Description
The literature suggests that the use of technology in higher education is motivated by two key factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Usefulness refers to how students and teachers perceive that technology can improve learning and teaching. Ease of use refers to users' perception of how easy it is to use technology to achieve their learning objectives.
However, there are still outstanding questions about the impact of these two factors on the intention to use technology in higher education. 
Research question
In particular, how do perceived usefulness and ease of use of technology such as learning platforms  interact to influence the intention to use that technology in higher education?
